# Level 3: Component Level (For Each Component)  
Component-level documents should be standalone and self-contained, providing a complete description of their specific component and its interactions with other components. They should include all relevant information from higher-level documents by copying any necessary content.
For components such as middleware that do not have direct user interactions but are involved in processing actions triggered by user activities, adjust the documentation to focus on system-level workflows and inter-component interactions.

Repeat the following sections for each component (e.g., Frontend, Backend, Middleware, etc)
Nomenclature:
    Assign a 4-10 character name to each component and name the document accordingly. Examples:
        LLD-FRNT: Low-Level Design Document for Frontend Component
        LLD-BKND: Low-Level Design Document for Backend Component
        LLD-AUTH: Low-Level Design Document for Authentication Component
Replace `[Component Name]` with the actual name of each component (e.g., `LLD-FRNT` for Frontend Component, `LLD-BKND` for Backend Component, etc.) and replicate the Level 3 structure for each component in your project:

## Design and Architecture  


### L3-LLD-[ComponentCode]: Low-Level Design (LLD) Document for [Component Name]  
The Low-Level Design (LLD) document aims to be a comprehensive and cohesive guide to implementing the component rather than a standalone list of architectural or design decisions. Each section should not only enumerate choices (e.g., which authentication protocol is used) but also explain how and why these decisions fit into the overall implementation. For example, when detailing authentication mechanisms, briefly describe the specific technologies employed—such as token-based authentication, session-based cookies, or single sign-on (SSO)—and illustrate how session management or state is maintained across multiple requests. Similarly, if your component handles user sessions, explain where session data is stored, how it is updated, and any relevant cleanup or timeout strategies. This level of detail provides the practical context developers need to effectively implement, integrate, and maintain the component’s features, ensuring consistency and clarity throughout the system.
